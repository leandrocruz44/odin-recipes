# odin-recipes
A project for the Web Development course by The Odin Project (Recipes)

In this project I will put all the knowledge I got in the HTML section
of the Foundation course by The Odin Project to make a recipes page. I'm
not going to use CSS yet, so things may not look so appeling to the eyes.
